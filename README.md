# August 2020 Portfolio

## Project Purpose
After 30+ days of learning HTML and CSS with projects targeting numerous sections. I decided to put all these lessons to good use by making a portfolio showcasing all the projects i completed while learning
I took this opportunity to implement other css elements i hadn't tried out before such as:

* CSS Grid
* Media queries for full length projects
* Inserting Font awesome icons.
* Sticky Navbar

## Contributors

## Home Page Sections
* Welcome section
* Navigation section
* Showcase section
* Project portfolio
* About me 
* Contact me

## Welcome 

The welcome section contains a basic h2 tag with a small description of the website.

## Navigation 

The navbar has the following links:
* Home
* My work
* About me
* Contact me

The navbar is styled to stick to the top of the screen when you scroll down.

## Showcase

The showcase section is styled to fit 100% of the viewport of big devices and 50% of small devices. There is a button at the center of the bigger devices with the following text - "Portfolio". This button does not appear on smaller devices.

The background of the showcase area is an image. This can be any image

## Project portfolio

The portfolio section contains a grid with a project title and a screenshot of the project. The screenshot is enclosed in an a tag. The link redirects to the github page of that project. 

On large screens there are 2 grid columns and on small screens there is only 1.

## About me

The about me section contains details of me and my journey.

## Contact me

The contact me section contains icons of social media sites where i can be contacted and an email address icon. The icons are arranged in a grid.
